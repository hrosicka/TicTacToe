## Conquer the Board

The game takes place on a familiar 3x3 grid. You'll take turns placing your mark (X or O) on the empty squares. But here's the catch: think strategically! A true champion anticipates their opponent's moves, blocking their attempts at victory while maneuvering their own Xs or Os to form a winning line.

## Claim Your Glory

The first player to score a line of three Xs or Os horizontally, vertically, or diagonally reigns supreme! But wait, there's more! If all the squares fill up without a winner, it's not a boring tie. It's a  Cat's Game ‚Äì a hilarious twist where the feline overlord claims the board as its territory!

## Game Instructions

1.  **Symbol and Color Selection:**
    * When the game starts, a dialog window will appear for Player 1 to choose their symbol ('X' or 'O') and a color for their moves by clicking on the respective buttons.
    * Another dialog will then appear for Player 2 to make their symbol and color choices. Player 2 cannot choose the same symbol or color as Player 1. Tooltips will indicate if a symbol or color is already taken.
    * Click the "Choose for Player 1" or "Choose for Player 2" button to confirm your selections.

2.  **Playing the Game:**
    * The game will randomly determine which player goes first and display a message box indicating the starting player.
    * Players take turns clicking on an empty square on the game board to place their chosen symbol.
    * The color of the symbol placed on the board will correspond to the color chosen by the player.

3.  **Game End:**
    * The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when all nine squares are filled (a tie, also known as "Cat's Game").
    * The winner (or "Cat's Game") will be announced above the game board.
    * The game board will automatically reset after a short delay, and a new game will begin with a randomly chosen starting player.
    * The statistics for wins and ties are displayed below the game board and are updated after each game.

## üåü Code Explanation

The code is structured as a class `TicTacToe` which encapsulates the game logic and GUI elements. Here's a brief overview of the key parts:

* **`__init__(self)`:** Initializes the main window, sets the title, initializes game statistics, creates the winner label, creates the game board buttons using `create_widgets()`, allows players to choose their symbols and colors using `choose_symbol_color()`, starts the first game with `start_game()`, and sets up the window closing protocol.
* **`on_closing(self)`:** Handles the window closing event by asking the user for confirmation.
* **`choose_symbol_color(self, player)`:** Creates a top-level dialog window where each player can choose their symbol ('X' or 'O') and a color from a predefined palette. It includes logic to prevent the second player from choosing the same symbol or color as the first player and provides visual feedback for selections.
* **`determine_first_player(self)`:** Randomly selects either "X" or "O" as the starting player for a new game.
* **`start_game(self)`:** Resets the game board, determines the first player, and displays an information message about who starts.
* **`create_widgets(self)`:** Creates the 3x3 grid of buttons for the game board and configures their click command to `click_button()`. It also creates the label to display game statistics.
* **`click_button(self, row, col)`:** Handles the event when a player clicks on a button. It places the current player's symbol on the button, checks for a win, and switches to the other player if the game hasn't ended.
* **`check_win(self)`:** Checks all possible winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and also checks for a "Cat's Game".
* **`switch_player(self)`:** Changes the `current_player` variable to the other player.
* **`show_winner(self)`:** Updates the winner label, disables all buttons, updates the game statistics, and schedules the `reset_game()` function to be called after a delay.
* **`reset_game(self)`:** Clears the game board, resets the winner status, starts a new game, and updates the statistics label.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:** Ensures that the `TicTacToe` class is instantiated and the game starts only when the script is executed directly.

So, are you ready to claim your glory on the Tic Tac Toe board? Download, run, and let the strategic battles begin! May your Xs and Os always land in the right place.
