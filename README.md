# Welcome to Tic Tac Toe

Get ready to dominate the grid and emerge victorious in this epic Tic Tac Toe battle! This isn't your childhood game anymore. It's a fast-paced, strategic showdown where only one player can claim the title of Tic Tac Toe Champion.

## Conquer the Board

The game takes place on a familiar 3x3 grid. You'll take turns placing your mark (X or O) on the empty squares. But here's the catch: think strategically! A true champion anticipates their opponent's moves, blocking their attempts at victory while maneuvering their own Xs or Os to form a winning line.

## Claim Your Glory

The first player to score a line of three Xs or Os horizontally, vertically, or diagonally reigns supreme! But wait, there's more! If all the squares fill up without a winner, it's not a boring tie. It's a  Cat's Game â€“ a hilarious twist where the feline overlord claims the board as its territory!
